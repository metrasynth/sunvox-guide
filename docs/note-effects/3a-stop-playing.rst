# 3A: Generate a new iteration of YY-line polyrhythm on track XX.

XX=module number
YY=number of lines to repeat

For example, repeating 3 lines in a total 4-line pattern to achieve polyrhythm.
However, if the total number of lines is divisible by the value of YY, there will be no extra lines, so nothing is done.
