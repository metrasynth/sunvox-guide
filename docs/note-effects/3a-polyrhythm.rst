# 3A: Generate a new iteration of YY-line polyrhythm on track XX.

XX=module number
YY=number of lines to repeat

This is used to realize polyrhythms, such as repeating 3 lines in a pattern with 4 lines in total.
However, if the total number of lines is divisible by the value of YY, or if the value of YY is greater than or equal to the total number of lines, no extra lines are produced and nothing is done.
